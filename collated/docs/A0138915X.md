##### Natural Language Commands
> Commands formatted in a language that has developed naturally in use and is intuitive for humans to understand. (as contrasted with an artificial language or computer code).

<br>

##### Natural Language Processing
> A branch of artificial intelligence that deals with analyzing, understanding and generating the languages that humans use naturally in order to interface with computers in both written and spoken contexts using natural human languages instead of computer languages.

<br>

##### Command-line interface
> User interface to a computer's operating system or an application in which the user responds to a visual prompt by typing in a command on a specified line, receives a response back from the system, and then enters another command, and so forth.
