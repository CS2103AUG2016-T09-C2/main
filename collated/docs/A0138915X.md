### UI component
<br>
<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800">
<br><br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/jimi/ui/Ui.java)

As shown in fig 3.1, the UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`, `AgendarPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`. 

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/jimi/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component:
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

#### Finding all tasks according to the dates you specify: `find`
Finds and lists all tasks and events in Jimi whose dates matches the requirements specified.<br>
Format: `find ["KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]..."] on|from DATE_TIME [to DATE_TIME]`

> * You can also input just a single date to search for tasks and events relevant to that day.
> * You can search the tasks and events by dates along with keywords as well.
> * Simply append the dates to the keywords.

Examples:
* `find from tuesday to wednesday`
* `find "attend" from tomorrow to next month`

#### <a id="com"></a>Marking a task as complete: `complete`
Marks an existing task as complete. <br>
Format: `complete TASK_INDEX`

> * Jimi will mark the task as completed at the specified `TASK_INDEX`.
> * Jimi will then move the completed task to a completed task list.
> * If you want to revert the task back as incomplete, use the [`undo`](#undo) command.

Example:
* `complete t1`

#### <a id="del"></a>Deleting a task/event: `delete`
Deletes the specified task/ event from Jimi.<br>
Format: `delete INDEX`

> * Jimi will delete the task specified by `INDEX`. 
> * If you need to recover your deleted task/event, use the [`undo`](#undo) command.
> * You can also delete a range of tasks/events by specifying the `to` keyword as well.

Examples: 
* `delete e2`
  Deletes the 2nd event in Jimi.
* `delete t1`
  Deletes the 1st task in the Jimi.
* `delete t1 to t5`
  Deletes the 1st task to 5th task in Jimi.

## FAQ

###How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
Simply copy the data file specified by the save location to the other computer. Install the app in the other computer and then specify the location of the data file you want to load using the `saveas` command, or just overwrite the default data file with the old file.
<br><br>
###Is there a way to be notified of upcoming tasks or events that are due soon?<br>
Jimi will display all overdue tasks at the top Agenda box, so you will always be notified of the most important details first. To display upcoming tasks or events, do use the find command to list them.
<br><br>
###What happens if I enter a wrong command?<br>
Jimi will display an error message that tells you that the command you entered is incorrect.
<br><br>
###What happens if I enter an invalid format?<br>
Jimi will display an error message that tells you that the format for the command you entered is incorrect and will also display the correct command format required for that command.
<br><br>
###Can I still use the mouse to use Jimi's functionalities?<br>
As Jimi is specifically catered to use the command-line interface, support for mouse-input is limited. You can display certain sections of the summary panel by clicking on the headers with the mouse although that is pretty much what Jimi can allow you to do with the mouse.
<br><br>
###How do I see all of my completed tasks?<br>
You can do so by using the `show completed` command which will [`show`](#show) all of your completed tasks in the main window.
<br><br>
###Can I use this with Google Cloud or my favourite cloud service?<br>
As of now, Jimi does not support any online functionality. However, there are plans for the development of online cloud services integration so users can easilly access their data from multiple devices with ease.
<br><br>
###How can I delete multiple tasks/events at once?<br>
You can do so by using the [`delete`](#del) command follow by the range of indices of tasks or events you want to remove.
<br><br>
###Jimi misinterpreted my dates/times! Why is it so dumb? <br>
We apologise for the mishap. Please submit an issue to us at our [issue tracker](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C2/main/issues) if you would like Jimi to accept particular dates/times. <br>
<br>
Regarding your question, given the nature of natural language processing, it is physically impossible for Jimi to interpret your dates/times with a 100% certainty. Much like how Apple's Siri and Google's Google Assistant fail to recognize accents from time to time, Jimi is similar in that regard. If it ever happens that Jimi misinterprets your dates/times, you can either [`undo`](#undo) or [`edit`](#edit) to make changes. <br>
<br>
A failsafe option, however, is to simply type proper calender dates i.e. `27 oct` or `1 feb 2pm`, Jimi will never get that wrong!
<br><br>
###Why is the find command so slow sometimes? <br>
We are experimenting with a near-match search agorithm to help better your experience. Please bear with us; improving the run-time of the [`find`](#find) command is an important focus of ours and we look to fix this issue in the near future.
