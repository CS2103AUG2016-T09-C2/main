# Developer Guide 

Jimi is a simple task manager specifically catered for people like [Jim](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2103/AY1617S1/contents/handbook.html#handbook-project-product). It is a Java desktop application that has both a Text UI and a GUI. Jimi handles most, if not all, input via the command line interface (CLI).

This guide describes the design and implementation of Jimi. Here, we share the inner workings of how Jimi works and how you can further contribute to its development. We have organised this guide in a top-down fashion so that you first understand the big picture before moving on to the finer details.

<br>
<br>

## Setting up

### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
    
2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Follow the steps from starting from step 2 in 
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious)).
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace.

<br>

### Importing the project into Eclipse

1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
2. Open Eclipse. (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given 
   in the prerequisites above.)
3. Click `File` > `Import`.
4. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`.
5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory.
6. Click `Finish`.

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish.
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process.)
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.

<br>

### Troubleshooting project setup

**Problem: Eclipse reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git**
<p>* Reason: Eclipse fails to recognize new files that appeared due to the Git pull. </p>
* Solution: Refresh the project in Eclipse:<br> 
  Right click on the project (in Eclipse package explorer), choose `Gradle` -> `Refresh Gradle Project`.
<br>  
**Problem: Eclipse reports some required libraries missing**
<p>* Reason: Required libraries may not have been downloaded during the project import. </p>
* Solution: [Run tests using Gradle](UsingGradle.md) once (to refresh the libraries).
 
<br>

### Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br><br>
The **_Architecture Diagram_** shown in fig 1.1 explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/jimi/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:
* Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other when app launches.
* Shutting down the components and invoke cleanup method where necessary when app shuts down.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.
<br>* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
<br>* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.
<br><br>
The rest of the App consists four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : Displays interactions with the user.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : Executes the commands.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components
* Defines its [_API (Application program interface)_](#API) in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram in fig 2.1) defines it's API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br><br>

The _Sequence Diagram_ shown in fig 2.2 shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete t3`.
<br>
<img src="images\SDforDeleteTask.png" width="800">
<br><br>
>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskBookChangedEvent` when Jimi's data changes,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram shown in fig 2.3 shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. 
<br>
<img src="images\SDforDeleteTaskEventHandling.png" width="800">
<br><br>
> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct 
  coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

### Logic component
<br>
<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/jimi/logic/Logic.java)

The `Logic` component:
* uses the `JimiParser` class to parse the user command.
* Creates a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
* Changes the model (e.g. when adding a task) and/or raise events along with the command execution.
* Encapsulates the result of the command execution as a `CommandResult` object and passes it back to the `Ui`.

Shown in fig 4.1 is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete t1")`
 API call.<br>

### Model component

<br>
<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/jimi/model/Model.java)

The `Model` component:
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores Jimi's data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

<br>

```

### Storage component

<br>
<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800">
<br><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/jimi/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component:
* saves `UserPref` objects in json format and reads it back.
* saves Jimi's data in xml format and reads it back.

<br>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.jimi.commons` package.

<br><br>
## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.<br>
<br>

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Shows that critical problems, which may possibly cause the termination of the application, are detected.
* `WARNING` : Shows that application can continue operation, but with caution.
* `INFO` : Shows information of the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Shows details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size
  
<br>

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file 
(default: `config.json`).

<br>
<br>

## Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:
* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose
  to run as a JUnit test.

**Using Gradle**:
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. 
   These are in the `guitests` package.
  
2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.jimi.commons.UrlUtilTest`<br>
   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units 
     (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.jimi.storage.StorageManagerTest`<br>
   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as 
      how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.jimi.logic.LogicManagerTest`<br>
  
**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
 our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. 
 In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.<br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.
 
 <br>
 
#### Troubleshooting tests
 **Problem: Tests fail because NullPointerException when AssertionError is expected**
 * **Reason**: Assertions are not enabled for JUnit tests. 
   This can happen if you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later)<br>
 * **Solution**: Enable assertions in JUnit tests as described 
   [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option). <br>
 * Delete run configurations created when you ran tests earlier.

<br>
<br>

## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

<br>

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

<br>

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.
 
 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Crete a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) 
    and upload the JAR file you created.
    
<br>
   
### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Jimi depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing.

You can automate the managing of these _dependencies_ using Gradle. Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which can remove the hassle of manually downloading and updating the libraries yourself.<br>

It is recommended to use Gradle to manage the dependencies for you, however, if you choose not to use Gradle for whatever reason you can also manually manage these _dependencies_ by:<br>
a. Including those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
b. Requiring developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>

###Explaining the UI

> <img src="images/UI_Explanation.png" width="800">

Jimi's UI is simple to use and compact, everything you need is right at your fingertips, literally. <br>
The UI comprises four main parts: <br>

1. A summary panel, containing important information at a glance. To expand the drop down lists, you can either click them, or use the [`show`](#show) command. <br>
2. Task/event tables, here is where you would find all your tasks/events. The top table is for tasks, and the bottom for events. Changes in the tasks/events will be updated in real time here too. <br>
3. A console box, essentially the voice of Jimi. It displays error messages, feedback from commands, tips and so on. This is basically your babysitter through your first usage, so pay attention to what it has to offer.
4. The command line, is where you would tell Jimi what to do. Enter your single line commands with the appropriate format and let Jimi do the dirty work.

### General Information About Command Format

* Commands have to follow a certain format as shown in the table above.
* Replace words in `UPPER_CASE` with your input.
* Items in `[]` are optional.
* Items followed by ellipses, `...`, means you can have multiple instances of that item.
* Items seperated by `|` simply means any of the items will work. E.g. `on|from`, typing `on` instead of `from` and vice versa are fine.
* The order of your input text is fixed. For instance, `add DATE_TIME due "TASK_DETAILS"` is invalid. 
* Some commands allow shorter command words for advanced users. Some commands, due to their critical nature e.g. `exit` or `clear`, you are required to type the full command word.
* Command words are also all case-insensitive i.e. `add` works as well as `ADD`.
* Below are accepted shortcuts of all commands.

Command | Default Command Word | Shortcuts  
-------- | :-------- | :--------
[Help](#help) | `help` | `h`, `he`, `hel`
[Add](#add) | `add` | `a`, `ad`
[Find](#find) | `find` | `f`, `fi`, `fin`
[Complete](#com) | `complete` | `c`, `co`, `com`, ... , `complet`
[Delete](#del) | `delete` | `d`, `de`, `del`, ... , `delet`
[Edit](#edit) | `edit` | `e`, `ed`, `edi`
[Show](#show) | `show` | `s`, `sh`, `sho`
[Undo](#undo)  | `undo` | `u`, `un`, `und`
[Redo](#redo) | `redo` | `r`, `re`, `red`
[SaveAs](#saveas) | `saveas` | None
[Clear](#clear) | `clear` | None
[Exit](#exit) | `exit` | None

<br>

**Input of Task/Event Name**
* You have to always surround task/event names with double quotation marks, `"`.
* Other than that, you can type anything within those double quotation marks.

<br>

**Input of Tags and Priorities**
* For tags, you can only type single words made up of numbers and letters. E.g. `t/IMPT`.
* For priorities, you can only type the following: `low`, `med`, `high`, `none`. E.g. `p/low`.
* Priorities are also case-insensitive i.e. `p/low` works just as well as `p/LOW` or `p/lOw`.
* A priority of `low` highlights your item in green; `med`, in yellow; and `high` in red.
* If you fail to specify a priority when adding an item, Jimi defaults it to `none`.
* For both, you cannot leave out the prefixes i.e. `t/` and `p/`. 

```
###### \UserGuide.md
``` md

> * Given the nature of natural language processing, Jimi can't gurantee that it will interpret your specified date/time with 100% certainty. If it ever happens that Jimi misinterprets your dates/times, you can either [`undo`](#undo) or [`edit`](#edit) to make changes. 
> * A failsafe option, however, is to simply type proper calender dates i.e. `27 oct` or `1 feb 2pm`.

<br>

**Input of Index**
* In order to differentiate the indexes of the tasks and events in the command inputs:
    * Indices are case-insensitive.
    * The index of tasks should be preceded by the letter 't'.
    * The index of events should be preceded by the letter 'e'.
    * Eg:
        * complete **t1**
        * delete **e3**
    * You can't go wrong if you follow the index that's written under the `No.` column of the tables.

<br>
<br>


## Features


#### <a id="help"></a> Viewing help : `help`
Teaches you how to use Jimi. <br>
Format: `help [COMMAND_WORD]`

Typing `help` will open this user guide in an offline version.

> <img src="images/Help.png" width="800">

Typing `help COMMAND_WORD` e.g. `help add`, will show help for that specific command in the console box.

> You can also type `help a`, equivalent of `help add` as all shortcuts mentioned above applies too.

```
###### \UserGuide.md
``` md
#### <a id="edit"></a>Editing a detail: `edit`
Edits the specified detail of any task or event. <br>
Format: `edit INDEX NEW_DETAILS` 

* Jimi edits the task/event specified by `INDEX`, `NEW_DETAILS` are simply the edits you want to make. <br>
* You can edit everything from the items name to its priority. You can leave out fields that you do not wish to edit too. <br>
* Although all fields are optional, they can't all be empty!
* The format of `NEW_DETAILS` that Jimi recognizes when editting:  <br>
    * ["NEW_TASK_DETAILS"] [due NEW_DATETIME] \| [[on NEW_START_DATETIME][to NEW_END_DATETIME]] [t/NEW_TAG] [p/NEW_PRIORITY] <br>
* Here are some examples:

If you type | Jimi will 
:-------- | :--------
edit t1 "finish this user guide" | edit just the name of task t1.
edit t4 t/bobz | edit just the tag of task t4.
edit e2 "go to concert" to monday p/LOW | edit name, end date and priority of event e2.
edit e1 on sunday | edit the start date of event e1.
edit e6 to tmr | edit the end date of event e6.
edit t2 due 8pm | edit the deadline of task t2.
edit e9 on tmr to next monday | edit the start date and end date of event e9.

> When editting an event, you can either edit just the start date alone or the end date alone or both.
> But if you wish to convert to an event from a task, `on|from NEW_START_DATETIME` is no longer optional, as will be shown below. 

<br>

* Using edit, you may also convert between item types. That is, you may freely convert between floating tasks (dateless tasks), events, and deadline tasks. <br>
* Below is the format of `NEW_DETAILS` that Jimi recognizes when converting: <br>

Converting to | What to type for `NEW_DETAILS`| Examples
:-------- | :-------- | :--------
Dateless Task | dateless | `edit e1 dateless`
Tagless item | tagless | `edit t1 tagless`
No priority item | p/none | `edit t4 p/none`
Deadline Task | ["NEW_TASK_DETAILS"] due NEW_DATETIME [t/NEW_TAG] [p/NEW_PRIORITY] | `edit e3 due tomorrow p/HIGH`
Event | ["NEW_TASK_DETAILS"] on\|from NEW_START_DATETIME [to NEW_END_DATETIME] [t/NEW_TAG] [p/NEW_PRIORITY] | `edit t1 "skip CS2103 lecture" on 29 oct t/IMPT`

> * If you ever make a mistake, don't be afraid to use the [`undo`](#undo) command. <br>
