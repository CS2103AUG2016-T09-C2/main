# Developer Guide 

Jimi is a simple task manager specifically catered for people like [Jim](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2103/AY1617S1/contents/handbook.html#handbook-project-product). It is a Java desktop application that has both a Text UI and a GUI. Jimi handles most, if not all, input via the command line interface (CLI).

This guide describes the design and implementation of Jimi. It will help you understand how Jimi works and how you can further contribute to its development. We have organised this guide in a top-down manner so that you can understand the big picture before moving on to the more detailed sections.

<br>

## Setting up

### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
    
2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps from step 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious)).
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace

<br>

### Importing the project into Eclipse

1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
2. Open Eclipse. (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given 
   in the prerequisites above.)
3. Click `File` > `Import`.
4. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`.
5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory.
6. Click `Finish`.

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish.
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process.)
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.

<br>

### Troubleshooting project setup

**Problem: Eclipse reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git**
<p>* Reason: Eclipse fails to recognize new files that appeared due to the Git pull. </p>
* Solution: Refresh the project in Eclipse:<br> 
  Right click on the project (in Eclipse package explorer), choose `Gradle` -> `Refresh Gradle Project`.
<br>  
**Problem: Eclipse reports some required libraries missing**
<p>* Reason: Required libraries may not have been downloaded during the project import. </p>
* Solution: [Run tests using Gradle](UsingGradle.md) once (to refresh the libraries).

### Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br><br>
The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/jimi/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:
* Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other when app launches.
* Shutting down the components and invoke cleanup method where necessary when app shuts down.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.
<br>* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
<br>* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.
<br><br>
The rest of the App consists four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : Displays interactions with the user
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : Executes the commands
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components
* Defines its [_API (Application program interface)_](#API) in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br><br>

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete t3`.
<br>
<img src="images\SDforDeleteTask.png" width="800">
<br><br>
>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskBookChangedEvent` when Jimi's data changes,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. 
<br>
<img src="images\SDforDeleteTaskEventHandling.png" width="800">
<br><br>
> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct 
  coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component
<br>
<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800">
<br><br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/jimi/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/jimi/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component:
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

<br>

### Logic component
<br>
<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/jimi/logic/Logic.java)

The `Logic` component:
* uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
* Creates a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
* Changes the model (e.g. when adding a task) and/or raise events along with the command execution.
* Encapsulates the result of the command execution as a `CommandResult` object and passes it back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete t1")`
 API call.<br>

<br>

### Model component

<br>
<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/jimi/model/Model.java)

The `Model` component:
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores Jimi's data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

<br>

```

### Storage component

<br>
<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800">
<br><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/jimi/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component:
* saves `UserPref` objects in json format and reads it back.
* saves Jimi's data in xml format and reads it back.

<br>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.jimi.commons` package.

<br><br>
## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.<br>
<br>

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Shows that critical problems, which may possibly cause the termination of the application, are detected.
* `WARNING` : Shows that application can continue operation, but with caution.
* `INFO` : Shows information of the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Shows details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size
  
<br>

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file 
(default: `config.json`).

<br>
<br>

## Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:
* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose
  to run as a JUnit test.

**Using Gradle**:
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. 
   These are in the `guitests` package.
  
2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.jimi.commons.UrlUtilTest`<br>
   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units 
     (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.jimi.storage.StorageManagerTest`<br>
   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as 
      how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.jimi.logic.LogicManagerTest`<br>
  
**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
 our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. 
 In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.<br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.
 
 <br>
 
#### Troubleshooting tests
 **Problem: Tests fail because NullPointerException when AssertionError is expected**
 * **Reason**: Assertions are not enabled for JUnit tests. 
   This can happen if you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later)<br>
 * **Solution**: Enable assertions in JUnit tests as described 
   [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option). <br>
 * Delete run configurations created when you ran tests earlier.

<br>
<br>

## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

<br>

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

<br>

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.
 
 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Crete a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) 
    and upload the JAR file you created.
    
<br>
   
### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Jimi depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing.

These _dependencies_ can be manually managed by:
a. Including those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
b. Requiring developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>

On the other hand, you can automate the managing of these _dependencies_ using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than the above alternatives.<br>

**General Information About Command Format**
* Commands have to follow a certain format as shown in the table above.
* Replace words in `UPPER_CASE` with your input.
* Items in `[]` are optional.
* The order of your input text is fixed. For instance, `add [DATE_TIME] due [TASK_DETAILS]` is invalid. 
* Some commands allow shorter command words for advanced users. Some commands, due to their critical nature e.g. `exit` or `clear`, you are required to type the full command word.
* Command words are also all case-insensitive i.e. `add` works as well as `ADD`.
* Below is a table of accepted command words of all commands.

Command | Default Command Word | Shortcuts  
-------- | :-------- | :--------
Help | `help` | `h`, `he`, `hel`
Add | `add` | `a`, `ad`
Compete | `complete` | `c`, `co`, `com`, ... , `complet`
Delete | `delete` | `d`, `de`, `del`, ... , `delet`
Edit | `edit` | `e`, `ed`, `edi`
Show | `show` | `s`, `sh`, `sho`
Undo | `undo` | `u`
Redo | `redo` | `r`
Find | `find` | `f`, `fi`, `fin`
SaveAs | `saveas` | None
Clear | `clear` | None
Exit | `exit` | None

<br>

**Input of Task/Event Name**
* You have to always surround task/event names with double quotation marks, `"`.
* Other than that, you can type anything within those double quotes.

```
###### \UserGuide.md

#### <a id="edit"></a>Editing a detail: `edit`
Edits the specified detail of any task or event. <br>
Format: `edit INDEX NEW_DETAILS` 

* Jimi edits the task/event specified by `INDEX`, `NEW_DETAILS` are simply the edits you want to make. <br>
* You can edit everything from the items name to its priority. You can leave out fields that you do not wish to edit too. <br>
* Although all fields are optional, they can't all be empty!
* Below is the format of `NEW_DETAILS` that Jimi recognizes when editting: <br>

Editting a | What to Type for `NEW_DETAILS` | Examples | What Jimi Will Do
-------- | :-------- | :-------- | :--------
Dateless Task | ["NEW_TASK_DETAILS"] [t/NEW_TAG] [p/NEW_PRIORITY] | edit t1 "finish this user guide" | Edit just the name of task t1.
Deadine Task | ["NEW_TASK_DETAILS"] [due NEW_DATETIME] [t/NEW_TAG] [p/NEW_PRIORITY] | edit t4 t/bobz | Edit just the tag of task t4.
Event | ["NEW_TASK_DETAILS"] [on NEW_START_DATETIME] [to NEW_END_DATETIME] [t/NEW_TAG] [p/NEW_PRIORITY] | edit e2 "go to concert" to monday p/LOW | Edit name, end date and priority of event e2.

* Using edit, you may also convert between item types. That is, you may freely convert between floating tasks, events, and deadline tasks. <br>
* Below is the format of `NEW_DETAILS` that Jimi recognizes when converting: <br>

Converting To | What to Type for `NEW_DETAILS`| Examples
-------- | :-------- | :--------
Dateless Task | float | edit e1 float
Deadline Task | ["NEW_TASK_DETAILS"] due NEW_DATETIME [t/NEW_TAG] [p/NEW_PRIORITY] | edit e3 due tomorrow [p/HIGH]
Event | ["NEW_TASK_DETAILS"] on NEW_START_DATETIME [to NEW_END_DATETIME] [t/NEW_TAG] [p/NEW_PRIORITY] | edit t1 "skip CS2103 lecture" on 29 oct [t/IMPT]

> <img src="images/Edit.png" width="600">

> * If you want to undo your edit, use the [`undo`](#undo) command.

```
