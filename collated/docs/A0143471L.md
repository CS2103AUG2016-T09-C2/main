| :------------ | :-------- | :--------- |
| Todoist |  Has a very simple design. <br>Offers a mobile app. <br>Has a feature where users are encouraged to earn "Todoist Karma", to track their productivity trends as they finish their tasks.| Free version is limited in its capabilities and  is not well-encrypted. <br>Some of the mobile apps have design issues (like being unable to sort tasks). <br>Free version does not come up with some features like reminders, filters, labels, and templates. |
| Trello | Can divide projects up by tasks, and then edit those tasks with descriptions, labels, checklists, and even attachments. <br>Is particularly helpful for teams working on separate tasks toward a greater project goal, where the tasks are in need of a pipeline. | Has no good way to use this system to prioritize tasks between projects. |
| Google Keep | Easy on the eyes. <br>Easy to use. <br>Integrates with desktop/mobile very well. <br>As expected from google, it integrates well with other google products too. <br>Voice memos feature. <br>Images feature. <br>Able to retrieve deleted items in archive. <br>Has reminders. <br>Reminders can be set location-based. <br>Can share lists. | No chronological representation of reminders. |

| Wunderlist | Easy to use for beginners. <br>Has reminder features. <br>Allows creation and sharing of lists and setting up deadlines to get them done. <br>Is useful for collaboration on these lists with other people. <br> Comes with a mobile and a smartwatch app. | Advanced users have to pay if they want access to better features that beginners might not want to use as much. <br> More of a power list making tool than a true GTD app. | 
| Any.do | Can sync lists across all devices. <br>Can share lists with other people. <br>Allows creation of recurring tasks. <br>Comes with a voice-entry feature, which allows you to create a list using voice commands. <br>Comes with a feature "Any.do Moment" which focuses on just the tasks due on the day itself. | Comes with limited themes. <br> Users have to pay to use their more advanced features. |

| Clear| Comes with a mobile app. <br>Differs from other task managers, as you can use gestures, such as swiping, to create, rearrange and mark tasks as complete on the mobile version, instead of tapping on the mobile.<br> Allows creation of separate lists.<br> Built-in reminder feature. <br> | Users have to pay to use this app. <br> |
| Habitica | Comes with a mobile app. <br>Comes as an RPG-style game to motivate users to complete tasks that are tracked in the app. | May be too quirky for more serious users or users who do not play RPGs. |
