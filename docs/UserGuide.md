# User Guide

At this point, we know you are just as excited as we are [about Jimi](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C2/main/blob/master/README.md). But before you start throwing your money at us (even though Jimi is entirely free), you should first learn **how to use Jimi properly**. What follows should guide you on how to setup, install and use Jimi easily. 

<br>

   e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will open this user guide in another window.
6. Some example commands you can try: 
   * **`add`**` "do laundry" `**`due`**` tomorrow` : 
     adds a task named `do laundry` due `tomorrow` to Jimi.
   * **`delete`**` t1` : deletes the 1st task shown in the current task list
   * **`exit`** : exits the app

###Explaining the UI

> <img src="images/UI_Explanation.png" width="800">

Jimi's UI is simple to use and compact, everything you need is right at your fingertips, literally. <br>
The UI comprises four main parts: <br>

1. A summary panel, containing important information at a glance. To expand the drop down lists, you can either click them, or use the [`show`](#show) command. <br>
2. Task/event tables, here is where you would find all your tasks/events. The top table is for tasks, and the bottom for events. Changes in the tasks/events will be updated in real time here too. <br>
3. A console box, essentially the voice of Jimi. It displays error messages, feedback from commands, tips and so on. This is basically your babysitter through your first usage, so pay attention to what it has to offer.
4. The command line, is where you would tell Jimi what to do. Enter your single line commands with the appropriate format and let Jimi do the dirty work.

### General Information About Command Format

* Commands have to follow a certain format as shown in the table above.
* Replace words in `UPPER_CASE` with your input.
* Items in `[]` are optional.
* Items seperated by `|` simply means any of the items will work. E.g. `on|from`, typing `on` instead of `from` and vice versa are fine.
* The order of your input text is fixed. For instance, `add DATE_TIME due "TASK_DETAILS"` is invalid. 
* Some commands allow shorter command words for advanced users. Some commands, due to their critical nature e.g. `exit` or `clear`, you are required to type the full command word.
* Command words are also all case-insensitive i.e. `add` works as well as `ADD`.
* Below are accepted shortcuts of all commands.

Command | Default Command Word | Shortcuts  
-------- | :-------- | :--------
[Help](#help) | `help` | `h`, `he`, `hel`
[Add](#add) | `add` | `a`, `ad`
[Complete](#com) | `complete` | `c`, `co`, `com`, ... , `complet`
[Delete](#del) | `delete` | `d`, `de`, `del`, ... , `delet`
[Edit](#edit) | `edit` | `e`, `ed`, `edi`
[Show](#show) | `show` | `s`, `sh`, `sho`
[Undo](#undo)  | `undo` | `u`, `un`, `und`
[Redo](#redo) | `redo` | `r`, `re`, `red`
[Find](#find) | `find` | `f`, `fi`, `fin`
[SaveAs](#saveas) | `saveas` | None
[Clear](#clear) | `clear` | None
[Exit](#exit) | `exit` | None

<br>

**Input of Task/Event Name**
* You have to always surround task/event names with double quotation marks, `"`.
* Other than that, you can type anything within those double quotation marks.

<br>

**Input of Tags and Priorities**
* For tags, you can only type single words made up of numbers and letters. E.g. `t/IMPT`.
* For priorities, you can only type the following: `low`, `med`, `high`, `none`. E.g. `p/low`.
* Priorities are also case-insensitive i.e. `p/low` works just as well as `p/LOW` or `p/lOw`.
* A priority of `low` highlights your item in green; `med`, in yellow; and `high` in red.
* If you fail to specify a priority when adding an item, Jimi defaults it to `none`.
* For both, you cannot leave out the prefixes i.e. `t/` and `p/`.

**Input of Date and Time in Commands**
* The input of date and time is flexible.
* Eg:
   * Tomorrow 2pm
   * Next Monday
   * 7/11/2016
   * 1 day from now
   * tmr
   * tdy
   * next week
* You can either input date, time or both.
    * If no time is given, the current time will be used instead.
    * If no date is given, the current date will be used instead.
* However, you cannot input none of them.
* The start-date & time of the events cannot be earlier prior to the end-date & time.

<!--- @@author A0140133B -->

> * Given the nature of natural language processing, Jimi can't gurantee that it will interpret your specified date/time with 100% certainty. If it ever happens that Jimi misinterprets your dates/times, you can either [`undo`](#undo) or [`edit`](#edit) to make changes. 
> * A failsafe option, however, is to simply type proper calender dates i.e. `27 oct` or `1 feb 2pm`.

<br>

**Input of Index**
* In order to differentiate the indexes of the tasks and events in the command inputs:
    * Indices are case-insensitive.
    * The index of tasks should be preceded by the letter 't'.
    * The index of events should be preceded by the letter 'e'.
    * Eg:
        * complete **t1**
        * delete **e3**
    * You can't go wrong if you follow the index that's written under the `No.` column of the tables.

## FAQ

###How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
Simply copy the data file specified by the save location to the other computer. Install the app in the other computer and then specify the location of the data file you want to load using the `saveas` command, or just overwrite the default data file with the old file.
<br><br>
###Is there a way to be notified of upcoming tasks or events that are due soon?<br>
Jimi will display all overdue tasks at the top Agenda box, so you will always be notified of the most important details first. To display upcoming tasks or events, do use the find command to list them.
<br><br>
###What happens if I typed in a wrong command?<br>
Jimi will display an error message that tells you that the command you entered is incorrect.
<br><br>
###What happens if I typed in the format wrongly?<br>
Jimi will display an error message that tells you that the format for the command you entered is incorrect and will also display the correct command format required for that command.
<br><br>
###Can I still use the mouse to use Jimi's functionalities?<br>
As Jimi is specifically catered to use the command-line interface, support for mouse-input is limited. You can display certain sections of the summary panel by clicking on the headers with the mouse although that is pretty much what Jimi can allow you to do with the mouse.
<br><br>
###How do I see all of my completed tasks?<br>
You can do so by using the `show completed` command which will display all of the completed tasks in the main window.
<br><br>
###Can I use this with Google Cloud or my favourite cloud service?<br>
As of now, Jimi does not support any online functionality. However, there are plans for the development of online cloud services integration so users can easilly access their data from multiple devices with ease.
<br><br>
###How can I delete multiple tasks/events at once?<br>
You can do so by using the `delete` command follow by the range of indices of tasks or events you want to remove.
<br><br>
###Jimi misinterpreted my dates/times! Why is it so dumb? <br>
We apologise for the mishap. Please submit an issue to us at our [issue tracker](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-T09-C2/main/issues) if you would like Jimi to accept particular dates/times. <br>
<br>
Regarding your question, given the nature of natural language processing, it is physically impossible for Jimi to interpret your dates/times with a 100% certainty. Much like how Apple's Siri and Google's Google Assistant fail to recognize accents from time to time, Jimi is similar in that regard. If it ever happens that Jimi misinterprets your dates/times, you can either [`undo`](#undo) or [`edit`](#edit) to make changes. <br>
<br>
A failsafe option, however, is to simply type proper calender dates i.e. `27 oct` or `1 feb 2pm`, Jimi will never get that wrong!
<br><br>
###Why is the find command so laggy sometimes? <br>
We are experimenting with a near-match search agorithm to help better your experience. Please bear with us as it is a non-functional requirement for now. Improving the run-time of the [`find`](#find) command is definitely an important focus to us.
